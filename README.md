**Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the emotional tone of a given text input.

**Features**

Sentiment classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.)
Model training and evaluation with high accuracy

**Project Workflow**

**Data Collection:** Gathered text data from publicly available sources (e.g., Twitter, movie reviews).

**Data Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).

**Model Development:** Trained classification models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Transformers.

**Evaluation:** Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tools and Technologies**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib

**Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy

**Results**

Achieved accuracy of 95% on the test dataset. Precision and recall indicate robust performance in sentiment detection.

**Applications**

Social media monitoring
Customer feedback analysis
Brand sentiment evaluation

**Future Work**

Extend analysis to multilingual datasets
Deploy the model as an API for real-time sentiment analysis
Integrate with visualization tools for dynamic reporting
